TODO On a scale of 1-10, we had to change our ideal syntax by ___. TODO

== 10/4 ==

We started by creating our project and setting up repos. We talked
about what we wanted to do and decided to implement our own syntax.
We took a look at our previous grammars and made a few edits to 
create our new grammar ideal. In particular, we kept the `Proof.`
and `QED.` declarations from our grammar actual, but
we went back to using `=` as our assignment symbol instead of
`=>`. Also, we dropped quotation marks and parentheses where
possible to make our syntax more like plain English.

We had some difficulty figuring out how to structure our intermediate 
representation. Though on the surface, our mathbot looks very similar to the
language implemented in external-lab, there are a few differences that make
it much more difficult to implement. For example, the operators on the lhs 
function differently than the operators on the rhs, so we needed to have
a way to show this difference in the ir. Also, each operator is only really
concerned with the thing to the right of it, so that makes our AST more
stick-like.
