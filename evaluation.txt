TODO On a scale of 1-10, we had to change our ideal syntax by ___. TODO

== 10/4 ==

We started by creating our project and setting up repos. We talked
about what we wanted to do and decided to implement our own syntax.
We took a look at our previous grammars and made a few edits to 
create our new grammar ideal. In particular, we kept the `Proof.`
and `QED.` declarations from our grammar actual, but
we went back to using `=` as our assignment symbol instead of
`=>`. Also, we dropped quotation marks and parentheses where
possible to make our syntax more like plain English.
