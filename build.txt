Author: Emily Blatter, Nick Carter, Sisi Cheng

Store the picobot program file in the directory of the repository. We provide
emptyRules.txt and rightHandRules.txt as example program files for the empty
and maze environment, respectively.

To build and run our program, run `sbt run <program-file-name>` in the repo
directory.
